      Long, long ago, there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter.
        
      He was very poor and sad also, for no child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age, and in his heart there was no hope of rest from work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave.
        
      Every morning he went forth into the woods and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky.
